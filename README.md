# Laravel Blueprint

Opinionated Laravel starter kit built for scalable, maintainable and production-ready applications.

> This repository contains my preferred stack, structure, tooling and architectural decisions for starting new Laravel projects.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Start projects faster
- Keep architecture clean and scalable
- Avoid repeating setup steps
- Enforce consistent development standards
- Production-ready from day one

---

## 🧱 Stack

- Laravel
- React (if included)
- Filament (if included)
- Docker
- MySQL
- Redis
- Mailhog
- PHPUnit / Pest
- PHPStan
- Laravel Pint

---

## 📐 Architectural Decisions

This project follows an opinionated structure:

- Service Layer for business logic
- Form Requests for validation
- DTOs for structured data transfer
- Action classes where needed
- Enum usage instead of magic values
- Separation of concerns
- SOLID principles

Folder structure is organized to improve long-term maintainability.

Example:

- Telescope – debugging
- Filament – admin panel
- Sanctum – API authentication

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

After working on multiple Laravel projects, I noticed repeated setup tasks and inconsistent structure decisions.

This blueprint represents my evolving engineering standards and preferred development workflow.

It will continue to improve over time.
